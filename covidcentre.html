    <h1><b>Building community and health system resilience during a crisis</b></h1>
    <p id="relief1">The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the lives of millions across the globe. The effects of the crisis
      have been
      felt
      deeply, especially by vulnerable groups living on the fringes. Caught amidst the socio-economic fallout of the
      disease
      and the all-pervasive sense of uncertainty and anxiety, children face heightened threats to their safety and
      well-being.

      All through the COVID-19 crisis and the lockdown in India, CHILDLINE 1098, the emergency helpline for children in
      need
      of care and protection, has continued to receive calls 24x7 without any disruption to take up interventions to
      prevent
      abuse, assist children in distress and provide emotional support.

      Since March 20th, CHILDLINE has answered over 27.5 lakh calls, and carried out over 2,09,727 interventions, where
      frontline workers have reached the location of a child to provide assistance to or rescue a child from distress.
      This
      kind of impact has been possible due to the scale and reach of CHILDLINE, which is today present across 595
      districts
      through 1,030 intervention units and 136 Child Help Desks at railway stations.

      CHILDLINE has also been at the forefront of the COVID-19 response, and has been working closely with district
      administrations, child protection bodies, health departments, law enforcement, and civil society networks to
      disseminate
      information about COVID-19, distribute hygiene kits, food and medical supplies, and extend emergency relief and
      rescue
      for children and families affected by the crisis. Read about how CHILDLINE has been responding on the ground here.
