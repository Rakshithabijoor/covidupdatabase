      <p>We are all being exposed to a huge amount of COVID-19 information on a daily basis, and not all of it is
        reliable. Here
        are some tips for telling the difference and stopping the spread of misinformation.</p>

      <hr class="my-4">
      <h3>FACT: Vitamin and mineral supplements cannot cure COVID-19</h3>
      <p>Micronutrients, such as vitamins D and C and zinc, are critical for a well-functioning immune system and play a
        vital
        role in promoting health and nutritional well-being. There is currently no guidance on the use of micronutrient
        supplements as a treatment of COVID-19.

        WHO is coordinating efforts to develop and evaluate medicines to treat COVID-19.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3>FACT: Studies show hydroxychloroquine does not have clinical benefits in treating COVID-19</h3>
      <p>Hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, a treatment for malaria, lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis, has
        been
        under study as a possible treatment for COVID-19. Current data shows that this drug does not reduce deaths among
        hospitalised COVID-19 patients, nor help people with moderate disease.*

        The use of hydoxychloroquine and chloroquine is accepted as generally safe for patients with malaria and
        autoimmune
        diseases, but its use where not indicated and without medical supervision can cause serious side effects and
        should be
        avoided.

        * More decisive research is needed to assess its value in patients with mild disease or as pre- or post-exposure
        prophylaxis in patients exposed to COVID-19.</p>
